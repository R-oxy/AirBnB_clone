# 0x01. AirBnB Clone - Web Static

## Background Context

Web static, what?

Now that I have a command interpreter for managing AirBnB objects, it's time to bring them to life! Before diving into the development of a big and complex web application, I'm taking it step by step to build the front end.

The initial focus is on "designing," "sketching," or "prototyping" each element:

- Creating simple HTML static pages
- Developing a style guide
- Incorporating fake contents
- No JavaScript involved
- No data loaded from external sources

Throughout this project, I'm learning how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML forms the structure of the webpage, and it should be the first thing to tackle. CSS handles the styling, creating the design. I understand the importance of getting the HTML structure right before diving into styling, as a solid structure is necessary for applying any design.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I'm expected to be able to explain the following concepts:

**General**
- Understanding HTML and how to create an HTML page
- Grasping the concept of a markup language
- Knowing what the DOM (Document Object Model) is
- Recognizing what elements and tags are in HTML
- Understanding attributes in HTML
- How a browser loads a webpage
- What CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is and how to add styles to elements
- Understanding classes and selectors in CSS
- Computing CSS Specificity Value
- Familiarity with Box properties in CSS
